### Q 3

Which journal entry reflects the following transaction?:

BOC receives a $2,000 cash deposit from a customer for custom goods that will be delivered next year.

Dr.  Advances from Customers      2,000

- Cr.  Cash                                          2,000

Dr.  Deposits    2,000

- Cr.  Future Revenue    2,000

-> Dr.  Cash           2,000

Dr.  Cash         2,000

- Cr.  Inventory       2,000

Dr. Cash     2,000

- Cr. Revenue   2,000

(Don't credit revenue until the goods are delivered. Credit a liability account to reflect the fact that the customer has paid for the goods in advance.)

### Q 4

Which journal entry(s) reflects the following transaction?:

BOC received $5,000 of cash from a customer who took delivery of goods that originally cost BOC $4,000 to acquire.

-> Dr. Cash                       5,000

- Cr.  Revenue                    5,000

- Dr.  Cost of Goods Sold   4,000

- Cr.  Inventory                     4,000

Dr.   Cash           5,000

- Cr.    Inventory          5,000

Dr. Cash                       5,000

- Cr.  Revenue                    5,000

- Dr.  Accounts Payable   4,000

- Cr.  Inventory                     4,000

Dr.   Cash   5,000

- Cr.  Inventory      4,000

- Cr.  Revenue       1,000

Dr.   Cash          5,000

- Cr.  Revenue         5,000

We need two entries: (1) debit Cash and credit Revenue for the cash received for the delivery of goods and (2) debit Cost of Goods Sold and credit Inventory for the original cost of the goods delivered to the customer.

(offset previous entry when buying inventory)

### Q 5

How much quarterly depreciation expense would be recognized for a building that originally cost $100,000 and has an estimated useful life of 10 years with a $20,000 salvage value?

$2,500

-> $2,000

$10,000

$8,000

$1,000

Under straight-line depreciation, the annual expense would be:

(100,000 - 20,000) / 10 = 8,000.  

But the question asks for quarterly, so the answer is 8,000 / 4 = 2,000.

### Q 6

Which journal entry reflects the adjusting entry needed on December 31?:

In November, BOC prepaid $30,000 of rent for December, January, and February (and it was recorded properly).  Now, it is December 31, the end of the fiscal year.

Dr.  Rent Expense        10,000

- Cr.  Cash                         10,000

-> Dr.  Rent Expense        10,000

- Cr.  Prepaid Rent                   10,000

No entry needed.

Dr.  Rent Expense        30,000

- Cr.  Cash                         30,000

Dr.  Rent Expense        30,000

- Cr.  Prepaid Rent                   30,000

We recognize Rent Expense for the month of December ($10,000 = $30,000 / 3) and credit Prepaid Rent to reduce it by $10,000 (its original balance was $30,000).

(previously:

Dr. Prepaid Rent 30k

- Cr. Cash 30k)

### Q 6b

It is December 31, the end of the fiscal year.  During December, employees earned $800,000 in salaries, but paychecks do not get issued until January 2.

Dr.  Salaries Payable      800,000

- Cr.   Cash                          800,000

Dr.  Cash     800,000

Dr.  Salary Expense      800,000

- Cr.   Cash                          800,000

No entry is needed.

-> Dr.  Salary Expense      800,000

- Cr.   Salaries Payable      800,000

We recognize (debit) Salary Expense based on the employees working for us and we credit the liability Salaries Payable to record our obligation to pay them in January.

### Q 7

Which journal entry reflects the adjusting entry needed on December 31?:

Last year, BOC purchased software for $10,000.  The expected life of the software is 2 years and it has no expected salvage value.  Now, it is December 31, the end of the fiscal year.  No other entries were recorded for this software during the year.

No entry needed.  

Dr.  Software Amortization Expense     5,000

- Cr.  Cash                                                    5,000

Dr.  Software Amortization Expense     5,000

No entry needed.  The building was not purchased this year.

Dr.  Depreciation Expense      50,000

- Cr.  Accumulated Depreciation    50,000

-> Dr.  Depreciation Expense      40,000

- Cr.  Building                            40,000

Dr.  Depreciation Expense      50,000

- Cr.  Building                            50,000

Dr.  Depreciation Expense      40,000

- Cr.  Accumulated Depreciation    40,000

(You get the building (credit the asset))

### Q 8

Which journal entry reflects the adjusting entry needed on December 31?:

In September, BOC received an order for $500,000 of products that will be delivered and billed in January.  Now, it is December 31, the end of the fiscal year, and no prior entry has been recorded for this order.

Dr.   Accounts Receivable   500,000

Dr.   Advances from Customers  500,000

- Cr.   Revenue                              500,000

-> No entry needed.

There should be no adjusting entry.  There has been no transaction yet and no revenue has been earned.
