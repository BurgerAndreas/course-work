$25

(cash from sales - cash to suppliers - cash to creditors = cash flow from operations.
100 - 60 - 30 = 10. loss on sale of equipment is not a cash flow and investing not operating.)

$(295,000)

(- cash warehouse - cash land - cash truck + cash building = cash from investing.
- 50,000 - 100,000 - 50,000 + 50,000 = - 300,000.)

(Change in depreciation expense does not change cash flow from operations since depreciation is a non-cash expense.)


### Q 7
Joe Doakes was reading the balance sheet of Gogoldze Inc. when he spilled coffee on it.  After the coffee spill, the balance sheet looked like this: 


($ millions)
12/31/2015

Cash
100

Accounts Receivable
245

Inventory
450

Other Current Assets
60

     Current Assets 855

Net Property, Plant, & Equipment
1,160

     Total Assets 2,015



Accounts Payable
160

Other Current Liabilities 
250

     Current Liabilities 410

Long-term Liabilities
900

Common Stock
50

Additional Paid-in Capital
300

Retained Earnings
coffee

     Total Liabilities and SE coffee

What was Gogoldze Inc.'s Retained Earnings at 12/31/2015?


$3,675


-> $355


$960


($55)


$550

(Assets = Liabilities + SE.  
SE = Common stock + additional paid-in capital + retained earnings.
SE = 50 + 300 + coffee.
Liabilities = current liabilities + long-term liabilities.
Liabilities = 410 + 900 = 1,310.
Assets = 2,015.
Assets = Liabilities + 350 + RE.
RE = 2,015 - 1,310 - 350 = 355.)
