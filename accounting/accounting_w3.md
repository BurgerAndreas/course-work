## Week 3: Cash Flow

### Q 1

Which of the following would be a cash flow from operating activities? (check all that apply)

Depreciation on a building (not a cash flow)

-> Payments to suppliers

-> Payments for advertising

Gain on sale of equipment (investment)

-> Collections from customers

### Q 2

Which of the following would be a cash flow from financing activities? (check all that apply)

-> Repayments of principal portion of debt

Payments to suppliers (operating)

Payments to acquire a company (investment)

-> Proceeds from issuing stock

Proceeds from selling equipment (investment)

### Q 2b

Which of the following would be a cash flow from investing activities? (check all that apply)

-> Proceeds from selling equipment

Proceeds from issuing stock (financing)

Purchases of inventory (operating)

Depreciation on a building (not a cash flow)

-> Payments to acquire a company

### Q 3

A company has the following cash flows:

Cash from operations 10

Cash from investing activities (1)

Cash from financing activities (9)

Which growth stage best describes this pattern of cash flows?

Early growth

-> Decline

Start-up

Perky

Stable

This pattern is typical for a company in decline.  The company still has a positive cash from operations, but is investing very little in long-term assets, indicating that it doesn't have many new opportunities.  The company uses its excess free cash flow to pay dividends, pay down debt, or buy back equity, which leads to a negative financing cash flow.  

### Q 3b

Cash from operations             (30)

Cash from investing activities (45)

Cash from financing activities  90

Which growth stage best describes this pattern of cash flows?

-> Star-tup

This pattern is typical for a start-up.  The company has not yet achieved enough sales to create positive cash from operating activities, but has to invest heavily to build the business.  So, the company has a large positive cash inflow from financing activities to fund both operations and investments.

### Q 4

A company bought $50,000 of inventory for $20,000 cash, with the balance due to the supplier in 30 days.  What is the operating cash flow in this transaction?

-> ($20,000)

($50,000)

$0

($30,000)

($70,000)

You can think of this as two transactions.  First, the company bought $20,000 of inventory with cash.  This is an operating cash flow.  Second, the company bought $30,000 of inventory on account.  This is a non-cash transaction.  So, the operating cash flow is ($20,000).

### Q 4b

A company bought a $1,000,000 building and $500,000 of land with a $300,000 cash down payment and used a new mortgage to pay the balance.  What is the investing cash flow in this transaction?

-> ($1,500,000)

($1,800,000)

($1,200,000)

($1,000,000)

($300,000)

Mortgage cash also counts as investing cash flow.

### Q 5

Which of the following would be shown as a negative number in the Operating section of the SCF under the indirect method? (check all that apply)

-> Gain on sale of equipment
(Gain on sale of equipment would be subtracted from Net Income under the indirect method (it increased net income but must be subtracted out because it is not operating, but investing).)

Decrease in Accounts Receivable
(A decrease in Accounts Receivable would be added back (decrease in a noncash asset = increase in cash on the balance sheet equation).)

Capital expenditures
(Capital expenditures are an investing activity.)

-> Decrease in Accounts Payable
(A decrease in Accounts Payable would be subtracted (decrease in liability = decrease in cash on the balance sheet equation).)

Depreciation on a building
(Depreciation is added back to Net Income under the indirect method, so it would be a positive number.)

### Q 6

A company has Net Income of $10, which included $2 of depreciation expense.  There were no other noncash expenses in Net Income and there were no gains or losses.  Accounts receivable was $20 at the beginning of the year and $25 at the end of the year.  Accounts Payable was $15 at the beginning of the year and $5 at the end of the year.  Inventory was $12 at the beginning of the year and $7 at the end of the year.  All other balance sheet accounts were unchanged over the year.  What was the company’s Cash Flow from Operating Activities?

-> $2

$7

$22

$12

($2)

Let’s do the indirect method! Start with Net Income of $10. Add back $2 of Depreciation Expense. Subtract the increase in A/R of $5. Subtract the decrease in A/P of $10. Add the decrease in Inventory of $5. The answer is $10 + $2 – $5 – $10 + $5 = $2.  

### Q 6b

Question 6
A company has Net Income of $20, which included $4 of depreciation expense.  There were no other noncash expenses in Net Income and there were no gains or losses.  Accounts receivable was $40 at the beginning of the year and $25 at the end of the year.  Accounts Payable was $25 at the beginning of the year and $15 at the end of the year.  Inventory was $22 at the beginning of the year and $27 at the end of the year.  All other balance sheet accounts were unchanged over the year.  What was the company’s Cash Flow from Operating Activities?

- A/R =  25 - 40 = -15
- A/P = 15 - 25 = -10
- Inventory = 27 - 22 = 5

(operating CF = Net income + Depreciation - A/R - A/P - Inventory \
= 20 + 4 + 15 - 10 - 5 = 24)

Let’s do the indirect method! Start with Net Income of $20. Add back $4 of Depreciation Expense. Add back the decrease in A/R of $15. Subtract the decrease in A/P of $10. Subtract the increase in Inventory of $5. The answer is $20 + $4 + $15 – $10 – $5 = $24.  

### Q 7

A company put together a preliminary version of its financial statements.  Its Net Income was $200, its Depreciation Expense was $40, and its Cash Flow from Operations was $90.  The accountant found an error in computing straight-line Depreciation Expense.  It should have been $50.  What is Cash from Operations after fixing this mistake? (you can ignore taxes)

$250

$0

$80

$100

-> $90

Net Income would drop by $10 with the extra expense. The amount of depreciation expense added back would go up by $10. These would cancel each other out and there would be no effect on Cash from Operations. So, Cash from Operations would remain at $90.  

### Q 8

A company sold PP&E for $200 cash.  Prior to the sale, the net book value of the PP&E on the financial statements was $240.  Thus, the company recorded a Loss on Sale of Equipment of $40 in Net Income.  What is the operating cash flow in this transaction?

-> $0

$40

$160

$200

$240

The answer is zero!  The entire $200 cash is an investing cash flow.  The loss will be added back in the operating section, but that is merely to avoid double counting, since the loss also shows up in Net Income (i.e., the loss reduced Net Income by $40, then we added back $40 in the operating section to get to “no effect” on operating cash flows).  

### Q 8b

A company sold PP&E for $100 cash.  Prior to the sale, the net book value of the PP&E on the financial statements was $80.  Thus, the company recorded a Gain on Sale of Equipment of $20 in Net Income.  What is the investing cash flow in this transaction?

$20

$0

-> $100

$120

$80

The entire $100 cash is an investing cash flow. The gain will be subtracted in the operating section, but that is merely to avoid double counting (since the gain also shows up in Net Income).

### Q 9

Which of the following transactions would result in the change in Inventory on the SCF being a different number than the change in Inventory on the Balance Sheet? (check all that apply)

-> Some of the inventory came in the acquisition of another company

Some of the inventory was sold for cash

Some of the inventory was stolen by employees

-> Some of the inventory is held by subsidiaries in countries that use a different currency

### Q 9b

During the year, a company sold $500 of inventory, paid $400 to suppliers for inventory previously purchased on account, purchased $100 of inventory for cash, acquired $75 of inventory from another company in an acquisition, and translated into US dollars the value of inventory held in foreign subsidiaries, which increased inventory by $25.  Which of these Inventory transactions would show up in the operating section of the SCF? (check all that apply)

-> Paid $400 to suppliers for inventory previously purchased on account

-> Purchased $100 of inventory for cash

-> Sold $500 of inventory

The value of inventory held in foreign subsidiaries increased by $25 when translated into US dollars

Acquired $75 of inventory from another company in an acquisition

Acquisitions and foreign currency adjustments were two reasons given in the video for why a number on the SCF might not match the change on the Balance Sheet.  Thus, those two transactions will not appear in the operating section.  In the other cases, the sale or purchase of Inventory, or payments to suppliers, will show up in the operating section.  

### Q 10

A company had Revenue of $1000, Depreciation and Amortization Expense of $100, Interest Expense of $100, and Tax Expense of $50.  All other Expenses were $500.  What was the company’s EBITDA?

$1000

$400

$250

$300

-> $500

Net Income or Earnings = Revenue - D/A - Interest - Tax: $1000 – $100 – $100 – $50 – $500 = $250. Then, we would add back Depreciation and Amortization Expense of $100, Interest Expense of $100 and Tax Expense of $50, to get EBITDA = Net Income + D/A + Interest + Tax: $250 + $100 + $100 + $50 = $500. Note that this is also EBITDA = Revenue – All Other Expenses.  

### Q 10b

A company had EBITDA of $1000, Depreciation and Amortization Expense of $100, Interest Expense of $100, and Tax Expense of $50.  What was the company’s Net Income?

($750)

$750

$1000

$1250

$950

(EBITDA = Net Income + D/A + Interest + Tax: $1000 = Net Income + $100 + $100 + $50.
Net Income = EBITA - D/A - Interest - Tax. Net Income = 750)

EBITDA = Net Income (or Earnings) + Depreciation and Amortization Expense + Interest Expense + Tax Expense.  Thus, $1000 = Net Income + $100 + $100 + $50 => Net Income = $1000 – $250 = $750.
