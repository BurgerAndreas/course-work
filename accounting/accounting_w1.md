## Week 1:

### Notes

Short:
- Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ equity

Details:
- Stakeholders Equity = Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings
- Retained Earnings = net income - dividends (+ Prior Retained Earnings)
- Net income = revenue - expenses
- Assets = Cash + Noncash Assets
- Common Stock (at Par) = Shares issued * par value
- Additional Paid-in-Capital = Shares issued * [market price – par value])

Full:
- Cash + Noncash Assets + Expenses + Dividends = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Prior Retained Earnings + Revenues 

Useful:
- Assets + Expenses = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Revenues

### Q1

Which of the following is a required financial statement?

Statement of Revenues and Expenditures

Statement of Tangible Equity

-> Statement of Cash Flows

Statement of Auditor Independence

Statement of Assets and Liabilities

Correct
The Statement of Cash Flows is the required financial statement.  The Statement of Auditor Independence and the Statement of Tangible Equity are things I made up.

### Q 2

Which of the following items reduces Net Income? (check all that apply)

Liabilities

Dividends

-> Expenses

Revenues

Stockholders' Equity

(Net Income = Revenues - Expenses, so Expenses is the only item on the list that reduces net income.)

### Q 3

Ending Retained Earnings = Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income – Dividends

=> 60 = 50 + NI – 15 => NI = 25;

Net Income = Revenues – Expenses

=> Rev – 100 = 25

=> Rev = 125


### Q 4

Which of the following transactions violates the balance sheet equation? (check all that apply)

Reduce cash and reduce a liability

Increase revenues and reduce a liability

This should not be selected
  Balances!  

Increase cash and reduce a liability

Correct
An increase to Cash would increase the Asset side, and thus would not balance a reduction in a liability.

Increase cash and reduce inventory (a non-cash asset)

Increase cash and increase an expense

Correct
An increase to cash would increase the Asset side of the equation and an increase to expenses would reduce the Liability and Stockholders’ Equity side, leading to an imbalance. 

### Q 5

Which of the following are assets? (check all that apply)

Retained Earnings

Common Stock

-> Cash

-> Accounts Receivable

Accounts Payable

### Q 6

Which of the following accounts would be increased with a Debit? (check all that apply)

(i.e. which are Assets or Expenses?)

-> Land

-> Advertising Expense

-> Prepaid Insurance

Accounts Payable

-> Cash

### Q 7

Which of these journal entries represent paying cash to reduce a liability? (check all that apply)

-> Dr. Income Taxes Payable       500

- Cr. Cash                                  500

(A correct entry must debit a liability and credit cash.)

Dr.  Land           100

- Cr.  Cash           100

Dr.  Cash               300

- Cr.  Accounts Payable     300

Dr. Cash                   1000

- Cr.   Notes Payable          1000

Dr. Retained Earnings     500

- Cr.  Cash                         500

### Q 8

Which journal entry reflects the following transaction?:

BOC sold 10,000 shares of $1 par value stock to investors for $5 per share.

Dr. Common Stock                 10,000

Dr. Additional Paid-in Capital     40,000

- Cr. Cash                                  50,000

Dr.  Cash                      50,000

- Cr.  Common Stock                 10,000

- Cr.  Additional Paid-in Capital   40,000

Dr.  Cash                      50,000

- Cr.  Common Stock          50,000

Dr.  Cash                      10,000

- Cr.  Common Stock                 10,000

-> Dr.  Cash                      50,000

- Cr.  Common Stock                 40,000

- Cr.  Additional Paid-in Capital   10,000

(We must record Common Stock at par of 10,000 (= $1 x 10,000) and put the remainder of the proceeds, 40,000 (= 50,000 - 10,000), in Additional Paid-in Capital.)

Common Stock (at Par) = Shares issued * par value

Additional Paid-in-Capital = Shares issued * [market price – par value]

Common Stock = 10,000 * 1 = 10,000

Additional Paid-in-Capital = 10,000 * [5 – 1] = 40,000

### Q 9

Which journal entry reflects the following transaction?:

BOC bought a $75,000 piece of equipment with cash.

Dr.  Cash     75,000

- Cr.  Equipment    75,000

Dr. Cash      75,000

- Cr.  Inventory     75,000

Dr. Inventory         75,000

- Cr.  Cash                 75,000


Dr. Equipment     75,000

- Cr.  Cash           75,000

-> Dr.  Prepaid Expense    75,000

- Cr. Cash                       75,000


(The correct debit is to increase Equipment, not Inventory (since we are not buying the equipment to resell at a profit).  We credit cash to reduce it.)

### Q 10

Which journal entry reflects the following transaction?:

BOC declared a $9,000 dividend to be paid in cash next month.

Dr.  Dividends Payable          9,000

- Cr.  Dividends Expense           9,000

Dr.  Retained Earnings           9,000

- Cr.  Cash                                  9,000

Dr.  Retained Earnings           9,000

- Cr.  Dividends Payable             9,000

Dr.  Dividend Expense             9,000

- Cr.  Dividends Payable               9,000

-> Dr.  Dividend Expense       9,000

- Cr.  Cash                           9,000

(On the declaration date, we reduce (debit) Retained Earnings (SE) and create (credit) a Dividends Payable liability.)
